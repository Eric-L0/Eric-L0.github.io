## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

* Lab 2,
   
    One of my 3 favorite labs was lab 2. This is due to the simplicity in learning the basics and I was able to become familiar with GitHub and how to format code. I also enjoyed learning how my code that I write can be run using ./a.out and print out what I wanted it to which for being a beginner made it feel good.

* Lab 4, Part 1:
   
    Much like my other favorite lab, (lab 2) Lab 4 still felt introductory due to the nature of the assignment and I still had guardrails to hold onto while writing down more “complex” code to my understanding. Converting the measurements with double operators was a struggle at first to get the right equations to do the right things but once done was so satisfying.

* Lab 7, Part 1:
   
   Lab 7 was also a favorite but this time for a different reason. Lab 7 felt difficult to my knowledge that I had at the time and was forced to look for help just to get a grasp upon how to approach different pieces of code. However, being able to write code in order to make parking rules was very interesting and showed me a creative way of how code is and can be implemented into real life scenarios. This was also a good practice on boolian operators which i struggled with and functions as well.
